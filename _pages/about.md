I am a PhD student at the University of Alberta, advised by [Marlos C. Machado](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~machado/). My primary interest is reinforcement learning. Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with [Philip S. Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/) and [Scott Niekum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/). I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
